     * Keyword channel audio processing is initialized and keyword detection is started. Upon keyword
     * detection, audio samples are written to the Keyword channel's pipe.
     *
     * Once a keyword is detected, the Far Field Voice service begins writing audio samples to the Keyword
     * channel's pipe whenever audio samples are available. Initially, samples may be written to the pipe
     * faster than real time as audio buffered within the service is provided as fast as possible. Once all
     * buffered audio is written to the pipe, audio will be written at a rate based on 16kHz sampling rate
     * (real time).
     *
     * The following FarFieldVoiceControllerListener callbacks can occur after the Keyword channel is started.
     *   onKeywordDetected()
     *   onStartOfCommand()
     *   onEndOfCommand()
     *   onNoStartOfCommand()

     * The sample offset values provided in 'onKeywordDetected', 'onStartOfCommand', 'onEndOfCommand',
     * 'onNoStartOfCommand', and 'onNoEndOfCommand' are the relative sample number with respect to the audio
     * samples written to the Keyword channel's pipe. A sample offset value of zero corresponds to the first
     * sample written after starting the Keyword channel.
     *
     * A normal sequence of callbacks after the keyword is detected:
     *   onKeywordDetected()
     *   onStartOfCommand()
     *   onEndOfCommand()
     *
     * The sequence of callbacks when the start of a voice command is not detected:
     *   onKeywordDetected()
     *   onNoStartOfCommand()
     *
     * The sequence of callbacks when the end of a voice command is not detected:
     *   onKeywordDetected()
     *   onStartOfCommand()
     *   onNoEndOfCommand()
     *
     * If the Keyword channel is already started, keyword detection is reset, audio samples are not
     * written to the Keyword channel's pipe until after a keyword is detected, and SUCCESS is returned.
