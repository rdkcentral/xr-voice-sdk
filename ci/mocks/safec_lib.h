/*
 * Compatibility header: maps xr-voice-sdk's local include name to the real
 * libsafec package headers (libsafec-dev / safec-common-wrapper in
 * production).
 *
 * In CI this file is copied from ci/mocks/ into ci/headers/ by
 * build_dependencies.sh so it is resolved on the generated-headers include
 * path used by cov_build.sh.
 *
 * This exists because xr-voice-sdk includes safec_lib.h directly, while the
 * native CI environment provides the underlying libsafec package headers
 * instead of that project-local wrapper.
